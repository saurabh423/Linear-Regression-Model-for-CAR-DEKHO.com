# Linear-Regression-Model-for-CAR-DEKHO.com
In this project, the dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com. This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
Also we've build a linear regression model on this dataset. Evaluated the fitted model on test data using different regression metrics. Also we've used linear regression model from statsmodels.api to run a similar regression and obtain parameter inferences for each of the model variables. Next, we tried if regularizing our model helps to perform well on the test dataset. For this, we've used Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net regressions on the dataset and checked for different values of the tuning parameter.
